  Love for Science and Art
</div>

My name is Ankit. I am an Engineering student at [National Institute of Technology, 
Srinagar](http://nitsri.net) (India). Currently I am in the last year of my B.Tech. 
course in Computer Science Engineering.

I love to sketch and paint. I am also a flute player. In my free time I like to 
build creative things. I am also a frequent user of [9GAG](http://9gag.tv). Anything
that relates to Science or Art is sufficient to gain my attention. I watch a lot 
of TV shows. I am also a good Web-designer. I love Chicken Shawarama.

Not to mention, I love to code.
