title: "Sweet sweet GUADEC"

When deciding mentoring organizations during GSoC preparations, GNOME was the 
top one on my list. And I'm glad that I got it. Otherwise, I might not have attended GUADEC.

It was my first GUADEC and also my first International visit. I made new friends, who will always be there to send 
me exotic chocolates from all over the world ;). Attended a large number of talks that opened my vision 
toward the existing GNOME projects. Met my mentor who turned out even cooler than 
expected (BTW he can fly Helicopter). Met some very cool people, the faces behind the success of GNOME foundation. 
Loved the interns' lunch, that was a great idea to connect with interns and to inspire them towards open-source contributions. I am gonna continue 
contributing to GNOME.

**I'm not a man of many words. But, I came in as a GSoC intern and left as a part of GNOME community.**
